Magistrala is modern, scalable, secure, open-source, and patent-free IoT cloud platform written in Go.

It accepts user and thing (sensor, actuator, application) connections over various network protocols (i.e. HTTP, MQTT, WebSocket, CoAP), thus making a seamless bridge between them. It is used as the IoT middleware for building complex IoT solutions.

For more details, check out the [official documentation][docs].
For extra bits and services see [our contrib repository][contrib].

## Features

- Multi-protocol connectivity and bridging (HTTP, MQTT, WebSocket and CoAP; see [contrib repository][contrib] for LoRa and OPC UA)
- Device management and provisioning (Zero Touch provisioning)
- Mutual TLS Authentication (mTLS) using X.509 Certificates
- Fine-grained access control (policies, ABAC/RBAC)
- Message persistence (Timescale and PostgresSQL - see [contrib repository][contrib] for Cassandra, InfluxDB, and MongoDB support)
- Platform logging and instrumentation support (Prometheus and OpenTelemetry)
- Event sourcing
- Container-based deployment using [Docker][docker] and [Kubernetes][kubernetes]
- Edge [Agent][agent] and [Export][export] services for remote IoT gateway management and edge computing
- SDK
- CLI
- Small memory footprint and fast execution
- Domain-driven design architecture, high-quality code and test coverage

## Prerequisites

The following are needed to run Magistrala:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) (version 26.0.0)

Developing Magistrala will also require:

- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) (version 1.21)
- [Protobuf](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf#protocol-compiler-installation) (version 25.1)

## Install

Once the prerequisites are installed, execute the following commands from the project's root:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml --env-file docker/.env -p git_github_com_absmach_magistrala_git_  up
```

This will bring up the Magistrala docker services and interconnect them. This command can also be executed using the project's included Makefile:

```bash
make run
```

If you want to run services from specific release checkout code from github and make sure that
`MG_RELEASE_TAG` in [.env](.env) is being set to match the release version

```bash
git checkout tags/<release_number> -b <release_number>
# e.g. `git checkout tags/0.13.0 -b 0.13.0`
```

Check that `.env` file contains:

```bash
MG_RELEASE_TAG=<release_number>
```

> `docker-compose` should be used for development and testing deployments. For production we suggest using [Kubernetes](https://docs.magistrala.abstractmachines.fr/kubernetes).

## Usage

The quickest way to start using Magistrala is via the CLI. The latest version can be downloaded from the [official releases page][releases].

It can also be built and used from the project's root directory:

```bash
make cli
./build/cli version
```

Additional details on using the CLI can be found in the [CLI documentation](https://docs.magistrala.abstractmachines.fr/cli).
