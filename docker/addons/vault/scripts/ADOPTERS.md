# Adopters

As Magistrala Community grows, we'd like to keep track of Magistrala adopters to grow the community, contact other users, share experiences and best practices.

To accomplish this, we created a public ledger. The list of organizations and users who consider themselves as Magistrala adopters and that **publicly/officially** shared information and/or details of their adoption journey(optional).
Where users themselves directly maintain the list.

## Adding yourself as an adopter
If you are using Magistrala, please consider adding yourself as an adopter with a brief description of your use case by opening a pull request to this file and adding a section describing your adoption of Magistrala technology.

**Please send PRs to add or remove organizations/users**

### Format

```
N: Name of user (company or individual)
D: Short Use Case Description (optional)
L: Link with further information (optional)
T: Type of adaptation: Evaluation, Core Technology, Production Usage (optional)
```

## Requirements
* You must represent the user or organization listed. Do NOT add entries on behalf of other organizations or individuals.
Pull request commit must be [signed](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/signing-commits) and auto-checked with [ Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://probot.github.io/apps/dco/)
* There is no minimum requirement or adaptation size, but we request to list permanent deployments only, i.e., no demo or trial deployments. Commercial or production use is not required. A well-done home lab setup can be equally impressive as a large-scale commercial deployment.


**The list of organizations/users that have publicly shared the usage of Magistrala:**

**Note**: Several other organizations/users couldn't publicly share their usage details but are active project contributors and Magistrala Community members.


## Adopters list (alphabetical)


**Note:** The list is maintained by the users themselves. If you find yourself on this list, and you think it's inappropriate. Please contact [project maintainers](https://github.com/absmach/magistrala/blob/main/MAINTAINERS) and you will be permanently removed from the list.
